1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- When I initialize a repository by using "git init", the command line inform me that "Initialized empty Git repository in PATH". And in this folder I have a new file named ".git" but it's invisible. If I want to see it, I should using command line to input "ls -a" in this directory.
- After I initialize a repository, all information about change of different version will be recorded by this file, ".git", and I can use many command of git to checkout old version or see the differnece between two commit version.


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a temporary area that used to store some uncommit version of program. Working directory is a directory on whereyou are working. Repository is a place that contains all my working files. Using "git add" to add what working files you want to add to staging area. Then I can commit all these files in staging area to repository at once, which regard all these change as one commit, one logical change, without adding one file per time.
